= Note

I've fork-ed the original repo and added a feature that I feel is useful for my current project and possibly in future projects. Just a personal preference. If you like it, get it here.

Features added on top:
- Ability to populate the address bar when the marker is moved on the map
- Ability to initialize with the address bar with default lat/lng

Enhancement:
- Auto-zoom in after an update on the position

Cheers,
Mickey
